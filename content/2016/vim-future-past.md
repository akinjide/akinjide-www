vim. VIM!

Writing software can be a pretty draining work. It is insanely fun when you’re in the zone and feeling good, and insanely dull when you’re not feeling your best.

Programmers spend most of their time looking at the development environment, so it is natural that we want something pretty as well as functional. Certainly, there are a lot of things professionals consider when selecting tools for their work. This is true for every profession, including software development. Quite often, however, selection is based on personal taste, not something easily tangible.

A great programmer could write her code into Notepad and still deliver great stuff.

What are the things a programmer should evaluate when choosing a set of programming tools like a programming editor of choice? The answer to this question is not as simple as it might sound. Software development is close to an art, and there are quite few “fuzzy” factors that separate a masterpiece from an overpriced collectable.

In my personal experience, I’ve found that my programming ability is directly correlated to my code editor. Since I’m having a pretty good day today, I thought I’d take a moment to reflect on programming and editors.


## What Makes Good Code Editor?

Whether you’re a programmer or a writer, a good text editor is a must-have on any computer,
in any operating system. The humble text editor is great for managing code, writing down quick notes, or just as a distraction-free writing tool.

In today’s development environment, a steep learning curve is a liability, regardless of feature set. Time is always valuable, so a good editor should be easy to get used to. Ideally, the programmer should be able to start work immediately, without having to jump through too many hoops.


### User Interface, Features, and Workflow

Let’s take a closer look at UI, different features and capabilities, and frequently used tools that should be a part of any programming editor.

Line numbers, of course, should be on by default and simple to turn on or off.

Snippets are useful for inserting standardized blocks of text in a fixed layout. However, programming is a lot about saying things just once, so be careful with snippets as they might make your code hard to maintain in the future.

The ability to lint, or syntax-check, the current file is useful, as is the ability to launch it. Without this facility, a programmer must switch to an external command line window, choose and run the correct command, and then step through error messages to find the source of the error.

Word-completion is helpful since it is fast, and almost as reliable as in-edit documentation, while being less intrusive. It is satisfying to enter just a few characters of a word and then hit enter to get the rest. Otherwise, one labors under the strain of excess typing, abhorred by lazy programmers, who want to type **ee** rather than the more lengthy **exponentialFunctionSquared**. Word completion satisfies by minimizing typing, enforcing coherent naming and by not getting in the way.

Source files can sometimes grow a lot. Code-folding is a nice feature that simplifies reading through long files.

Find/Replace with scope limitation to local, incremental, or global with meta characters and regular expressions are part of the minimum requirement these days, as is syntax highlighting.


### IDE vs General Purpose Text Editor

An integrated development environment (IDE) (or interactive development environment) is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development. An IDE normally consists of a source code editor, build automation tools, and a debugger, and many support lots of additional plugins and extensions.

Text editors are simpler applications. Compared to IDEs, they usually correspond to just the code editor segment of an IDE. However, they are often much more than that. IDEs are created to serve the purpose of software development, while many text editors are designed to be used by non-programmers as well.


#### Select JetBrains IDE: IntelliJ IDEA, RubyMine, PyCharm, PHPStorm

![JetBrains Icon][]


[JetBrains][] Offers a family of IDEs for Java, Ruby, Python and PHP; all based on the same core engine.
Very capable in its own right, JetBrains IDEs have been gaining a growing following.

However, they are not free, but you'd get community editions for free, and ultimate version for a 30-day trial is available, and
pricing is reasonable.


### Other IDE and Text Editor

![Editor Logos][]


Over one year, I have gone through quite a number of editors, below are my thoughts about them:

[Vi/Vim][] a powerful terminal-based editor. Designed to bring simplicity of Vi to every platform and
programmer who need a configurable but not too-heavy editor, it comes standard with most *NIX OS.

Having Vim skills will make your life much simpler when operating through SSH, and you won't have
problems with speed once you get familiar with keystrokes and commands. It supports dozens of languages,
keeps a history of your actions so you can easily repeat or undo them, supports macro recording,
automatically recognizes file types, and lives -- once installed—at your command line.

The learning curve is still quite steep (although its extensive help is useful for beginners), also its
free (GPL licensed) meaning instead of paying for the app, the team behind it suggests you donate to
children in Uganda who could use the support via the ICCF.

[Sublime Text][] is a truly Cross-platform and feature packed text editor. It is closed source, so it can't
be modified at low level. It offers a minimal and straightforward UI, such as a scaled down display code
on the right of the UI, allowing users to quickly scroll through their code and navigate with relative ease.

It is distributed as evaluation software (meaning it’s free to try, but there’s no time limit on how long you can use it for free)
and a full license will cost you $70.

[Atom][] an Open Source project that can easily be hacked to suit your needs. While it is still a work in progress, its a very capable editor with a vibrant community of programmers
keen on new extensions, JavaScript libraries and more. It’s built by the team at GitHub, and incorporates some of the lessons the
team there learned by managing so much code on a regular basis. It’s flexible, customizable,
themeable, and even though it’s relatively new, it already has a large following and tons of plugins, thanks to its open API.

Its downsides include some UI quirks, the possibility that some add-on packages could misbehave,
and reported performance issues when working with (very) big files. But the project is under active development,
and current shortcomings are likely to be improved.

[Visual Studio Code][] Another widely used IDE, Visual Studio is very popular among .NET programmers, but has been adapted to many different platforms. We could argue that its monolithic architecture is a rock that will pull it under the water, but it is still one of the most popular platforms among programmers.


### My Thoughts and Choice

It would be presumptuous to declare just one as the best programming editor among these great tools. And there are quite a few editors I did not even try. There is no one-size-fits-all solution. This is what compelled me to try out a number of different editors.

I'm currently using [Vi/Vim][], but its because it fits my requirements. I have been able to develop and maintain Node.js code-base. Your line of development might set a different set of requirements, and I hope I saved you some time in researching for the most appropriate programming editors.


## Vim in Action

A picture is worth a thousand words. I won’t bore you any further, here are some
screenies of vim in action.

This first picture is just a simple display of vim with version 7.4 (note the status bar at the bottom):

![Vim Version 7.4][]

Next, we have a single vim window open, broken into two panes: vertically split. As you can see, this
makes coding quite convenient and fun.

![Vim Multiple Panes][]

Here I just entered vim command mode `:command`, and activated [Ntree][] to list files in my cwd. Nice huh?

## Installation

Console version of vim is built into Mac OS, but it is outdated and not compiled
 with Ruby and Python support. Vim uses `.vimrc` configuration file to load custom configuration settings;
 this is incompatible with Vim 7.2. However, there are few rather simple options for
 updating Vim. :)

[Homebrew][] is every programmer OS X package manager. If you are not familiar with Homebrew, check it
out. You can use Homebrew to install MacVim, which includes both a GUI and console version of Vim 7.3

```bash
$ brew install macvim --override-system-vim

# If you need the app bundle linked in /Applications folder.
$ brew linkapps
```

Using `--override-system-vim` flag will instruct brew to setup the necessary symlinks to replace
the system console Vim with the version provided by MacVim.

Vim shipped with MacVim might not be good enough, you also have the option to build Vim directly from
the source using Homebrew.

```bash
# mercurial required - install if you don't already have it.
$ brew install mercurial

# install Vim
$ brew install vim

# if /usr/bin is before /usr/local/bin in your $PATH,
# hide the system Vim so the new version is found first
$ sudo mv /usr/bin/vim /usr/bin/vim73

# should return /usr/local/bin/vim
$ which vim
```

If you're interested in Vim, but don't want to install Homebrew. You can download and install the
[MacVim][] app bundle and setup an alias to point to its version of Vim.
Assuming you have MacVim installed to `/Applications/`

```bash
alias vim='/Applications/MacVim.app/Contents/MacOS/Vim' # or something like that
```


## Upgrading to Vim 7.4

It's best to not muck with the Apple installed bits, don't overwrite the buit-in Vim, OS X
expects that nothing will ever change in `/usr/bin` unbeknownst to it, so any time you overwrite
stuff in there you risk breaking some intricate interdependency. And, Let's say you do break
something -- there's no way to "undo" that damage. You will be sad and alone. You may have to
reinstall OS X


![Sasuke VS Naruto Battle][]


### Dark Side

Assuming you're set on doing that, you are definitely on track. To install on top of your
current installation, you need to set the "prefix" directory. That's done like this:

```bash
# Download, compile, and install the latest Vim
$ hg clone https://bitbucket.org/vim-mirror/vim or git clone https://github.com/vim/vim.git

$ cd vim
$ ./configure --prefix=/usr
$ make
$ sudo make install
```

You can pass "configure" a few other options too, if you want. Do `./configure --help`
to see them. I hope you've got a backup before you do it, though, in case something goes wrong....


### The One True Way

The "clean" way is to install in a separate place, and make the new binary higher priority in
the $PATH. Here is how I recommend doing that with config parameters:

```bash
# Create the directories you need
$ sudo mkdir -p /opt/local/bin

# Download, compile, and install the latest Vim
$ cd ~
$ hg clone https://bitbucket.org/vim-mirror/vim or git clone https://github.com/vim/vim.git

$ cd vim
$ ./configure --prefix=/opt/local \
              --enable-pythoninterp=yes
$ make
$ sudo make install

# Add the binary to your path, ahead of /usr/bin
$ echo 'PATH=/opt/local/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bash_profile

# Reload bash_profile so the changes take effect in this window
$ source ~/.bash_profile
```

**NOTE**: Contrasted with old config parameters of vim, there is only a difference, that is the parameter `--enable-pythoninterp` is "yes" or "dynamic". The old one is `--enable-pythoninterp=dynamic`, which leads to the “py library not been loaded”. If this parameter is "yes", all the problems are solved.

Voila! Now when we use vim we will be using the old one. But, to get back to our old configuration in the event of huge f*ckups, we can just delete the `/opt` directory.

```bash
$ which vim
/opt/local/bin/vim

$ vim --version | head -n 2
VIM - Vi IMproved 7.4 (2013 Aug 10, compiled Nov  4 2015 00:35:01)
MacOS X (unix) version
```

See how clean this is.

I recommend not to install in `/usr/local/bin` when you want to override binaries in /usr/bin,
because by default OS X puts `/usr/bin` higher priority in "$PATH" than `/usr/local/bin`, and
screwing with that opens its own can of worms.... So, that's what you SHOULD do.

**NOTE**: This can be done with [Vim 8.0][] as well. You should check it out.

## Configuration

Vim can be configured also however you'd like, and it requires almost no configuration to be useful. Building a
`.vimrc` file takes time and poking around.

Below is my `~/.vimrc` file, and is personalized for my own usage, but you can [fork][] and use it however
you'd like. Might look long, but it's very simple:

```viml
" Use Vim settings, rather then Vi settings (much better!). This must be
" first, because it changes other options as a side effect.
set nocompatible

. . .
```

The changes I made are much and for my own preferences but don't be dismayed, hack it however you'd like. Here's what my changes do:

- I use ([vundle][]) to manage my plugins.
- Set general config like line numbers, syntax highlighting and other cool stuff.
- Vim enables file swaps and backups this can be annoying at times, but you can give it a try.
- Indentation, every programmer needs this.
- Configure stuff like line length and line breaks.
- Auto reloading .vimrc when you reconfigure it.
- Set plugins configuration that vim will load into your terminal.

As you can see, I made quite much changes to vim in order for it to be useful to me.


## Takeaway

![Walking Away Sketch][]


Every programming language, be it Java, C#, PHP, Python, Ruby, JavaScript, and so on, has its own development practices related to project structure, debugging, and deploying. However, one thing they all have in common is writing code.

The next time you're about to dive into some code, take a second or two and analyze what tool it is you're about to use. Vim is insanely fun, but navigating through code is even more fun.

Now get out there and write some code with **vim**!


## Resources

If you'd like to learn or give vim a try, here are some resources to get you started. Vim has become
my favorite and most used tool especially when editing files on servers; started using it late last
year. I'd highly recommend it to any programmer who does a lot of server side stuff.

- [Installation][]
- [The main vim website][]
- [vim wiki][]
- `man vim` has great information and is highly readable.
- `vim tutor` is designed to describe enough of the commands that you will be able to easily use Vim as an all-purpose editor.
- [vim source][]
