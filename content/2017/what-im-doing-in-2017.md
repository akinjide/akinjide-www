![Yellow Happy Star][]


Time seems to fly, doesn't it? Well, a new year's here and I've completely changed my opinion about new year's resolutions, I always thought they were silly. However, the thought of starting a new year makes me feel **optimistic** about things to come.

Looking back at last year I focused more on: building myself -- my persona -- learning and using lots of tech stuff. Some goals were specific enough that I accomplished them, while some were way too vague and didn’t materialize.

Just yesterday I thought it would be appropriate to do a brain dump of my plans and ideas for 2017. But I figured out instead of focusing on the outcome (e.g. the goals), I should focus on the process. Over the past year I’ve seen I'm indifferent to habit building so I would be focusing on building habits into my daily routine.


## Habits

This year I’m going to be trying a lot of new things, and want to hold myself accountable. I will be using apps like [Momentum Habit Tracker][] to track my habits.

Other than the below, in more general terms, there are a lot of other things I’d like to do this year (at least, I hope!), but I really want to work on this ones for 2017:

- Spend at least 30 minutes per day working on open source code.
- Start a new reading habit. By the end of the year I want to be in the habit of reading for at least one hour per day.
- Start a new exercise habit. By the end of the year I want to be in the habit of exercising for at least 30 minutes 5 times a week (take a walk, hit the Gym, ride a bike--something).
- Limit soda drinks consumption.
- Tidy up my apartment for 10 minutes per day.
- Every end of month chill out with friends.
- I’m finally at a point where I can do a bit of travel casually, and this year I plan on doing some.
- Give at least one technical presentation at a programming meet up. I’m a pretty shy guy, but would like to make myself step out.
- Review my personal and professional progress every month, etc. Certain things like this are easily overlooked as time passes, but are things that I’d like to ensure I do so that I can make necessary adjustments to myself when necessary.


## Tech Stuff

2016 was a big year for me in terms of learning and using tech stuff. The real love of my life is programming. I’ve been programming (or playing around on the computer) every single day. Over the next year, I’m looking forward to doing a lot of coding, interacting with other programmers, and to spend a lot of time mastering the tech stuff that I use daily, breaking out of the intermediate level and enter the expert level. It’s very hard for me to gauge my progress in this area as it is entirely subjective, and the field of programming itself contains limitless information that is impossible for any one person to learn. To combat this, I plan to continue building software using these technologies, learning new techniques, and tools as I go.

Another thing I’d like to do this year is improve my editing skills with [Vim][]. While I’ve been using Vim for a long time, I still consider myself a complete n00b but I’m intensely driven to become better. I'd watch an episode once a week of [vimcasts][], and specifically practice the video topic that week to commit the topic to memory.

2016 was a good year. Here's to doing cool stuff in 2017, having fun and connecting the dots. :)
